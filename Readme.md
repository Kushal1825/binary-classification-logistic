# Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression

## üìå Objective
The goal of this project is to build a **binary classifier** using **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a tumor is **Malignant (M)** or **Benign (B)**, based on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**.

This task demonstrates:
- Binary classification with logistic regression  
- Feature preprocessing and standardization  
- Model evaluation using **confusion matrix, precision, recall, ROC-AUC**  
- Understanding the **sigmoid function** and threshold tuning

## üìä Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset  
- **Source**: Provided as `data.csv`  
- **Shape**: 569 rows √ó 31 features (+ 1 target column `diagnosis`)  
- **Target Variable**:  
  - `M` ‚Üí Malignant (encoded as `1`)  
  - `B` ‚Üí Benign (encoded as `0`)  

Columns include various computed features of cell nuclei (e.g., `radius_mean`, `texture_mean`, etc.).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Removed unnecessary columns (`id`, `Unnamed: 32`)  
   - Encoded target labels (`M=1`, `B=0`)  

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Standardized features using **StandardScaler**  

3. **Train/Test Split**
   - 70% training, 30% testing  

4. **Model Training**
   - Trained a **Logistic Regression** model (`max_iter=500`)  

5. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - ROC-AUC score and ROC Curve  

6. **Threshold Tuning**
   - Adjusted sigmoid cutoff values (0.4, 0.5, 0.6) to study effect on predictions

## üìà Results
- The model achieved **high accuracy and ROC-AUC score**.  
- Confusion matrix and classification report indicate that logistic regression is effective for this dataset.  
- ROC Curve shows strong separation between classes.
